In this first project, you will develop a “non-replicated” blockchain
that will be stored at an untrusted server known as the ”blockchain master”. Access to the blockchain is controlled by mutual exclusion. In other
words, a client needs to get mutual exclusion over the blockchain in order
to add a transaction to the blockchain. You should develop the application logic that uses Lamport’s Distributed Solution to achieve mutual
exclusion.
